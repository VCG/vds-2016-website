## Format

The symposium will feature a series of invited presentations by leading data scientists covering visualization in data science. **In addition, there will be presentations by speakers selected from submitted abstracts.**

## Abstracts / Talks

Abstract submissions should be one page and describe the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. We would like to particularly encourage **abstracts that cross disciplinary boundaries and show how visualization in data science can be a catalyst for discovery**. Speakers, their biography and a short version of the abstract will be published on the symposium website.

### Review Process

Abstract submissions will be managed by the Program Chairs and sent to external reviewers to evaluate the workâ€™s relevance to VDS. 

### Submission and Formatting Guidelines

Formatting is informal, we encourage creativity. Please limit your abstract to one page.

To submit a paper please use the Precision Conference System (details will be provided at a later time). <!-- After logging in go to "new submissions" and select "Submit to Papers" for VDS 2015. -->
