bio: |
   I have recently accepted the position of Director of Data Science at STATS. Previously, I was an Associate Research Scientist at Disney Research Pittsburgh, where I conducted research into Group Behavior and Sport Analytics. My research centers on representing, learning and predicting both cooperative and adversarial groups using spatiotemporal data - with application to continuous sports and audience domains.  Before that, I was  at the Robotics Institute at CMU as well as at the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh where I conducted my research on using facial expressions to aid in the diagnosis of medical conditions (such as Pain, Depression and Facial Paralysis) with Prof. Jeff Cohn.
